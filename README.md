Xmlips - XML in PowerShell
==========================

The module provides cmdlets for basic operations on XML.

#### Read-Xml

It reads an XML document from a file. The returned document watches for
changes. Its method Save() saves XML to the source file if the document
is changed. It optionally creates a backup copy or the original file.

#### Get-Xml

It is similar to the built-in Select-Xml. Main differences:

- input is nodes, paths are not supported
- output is nodes or PSObject, not node info
- it supports variables in XPath expressions
- it supports Property to get data as PSObject

#### Find-Xml

It gets a single element specified by its name, key attribute name, and
unique value. If the element is not found then it is created with the
specified key attribute value.

#### Add-Xml

It creates and adds a new element to the specified.

#### Set-Xml

It sets the specified attribute values.

#### Remove-Xml

It removes the specified nodes.
