SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Xmlips - XML in PowerShell

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module provides cmdlets for basic operations on XML.

    Read-Xml
        It reads an XML document from a file. The returned document watches for
        changes. Its method Save() saves XML to the source file if the document
        is changed. It optionally creates a backup copy or the original file.

    Get-Xml
        It is similar to the built-in Select-Xml. Main differences:
        - input is nodes, paths are not supported
        - output is nodes or PSObject, not node info
        - it supports variables in XPath expressions
        - it supports Property to get data as PSObject

    Find-Xml
        It gets a single element specified by its name, key attribute name, and
        unique value. If the element is not found then it is created with the
        specified key attribute value.

    Add-Xml
        It creates and adds a new element to the specified.

    Set-Xml
        It sets the specified attribute values.

    Remove-Xml
        It removes the specified nodes.
